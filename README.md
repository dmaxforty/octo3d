# octo3d

Octo3d will be a free, open source 3D game engine.
It is aimed to nostalgic game developers that they miss the Gen 6 era. You'll enjoy making games like it's 2002.

It'll be made from scratch, using OpenGL ~1.3 and C++98 for the engine core.

# Main goals

- Provide a stable base game engine
- Cross-platform (Windows, Mac and Linux)
- Ensure that older Linux and Windows version works correctly
- Provide a good, useful documentation

# Technology used

- Main engine core: C++98
- Graphics: OpenGL ~1.3
- Window manager: Qt?
- Scripting language: Probably based on Python?
